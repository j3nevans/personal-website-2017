Curation and branding for MICA Design League's fall exhibition.

The exhibition focuses on the idea of design systems, patterns, process, and the contexts in which they exist. Often we view design artifacts as independent from the larger context or systems in which they were created (i.e. a logo independent from its full brand system, a polished poster without process). This method of viewing design often does a disservice to both the designer and the viewer because much of the design thinking is lost. We are interested in collecting work that is multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary, process-driven, and/or explores a theme or idea in depth.
